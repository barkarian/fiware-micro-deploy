To run the application locally on your machine run :docker-compose up or even better :bash _bashScripts/cleanStart.sh(ro clean previous volumes) from the main directory.
After that you have to go to http://localhost:5001/ get the oauth2 credentials and update "/app-express/.env" file.

The first user you are going to create it's gonna be an admin too.
A prototype with dummy data may exist (if server is still running in that case you can ask me to resume the server) at: http://34.118.86.60/.
